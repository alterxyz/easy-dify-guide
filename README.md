# easy-dify-guide

A friendly, easy-to-follow guide for Dify newbies

## Introduction

This is a guide for most Dify users from beginner to advanced.

Handcrafted with ❤️ by [AlterXYZ](https://github.com/alterxyz/easy-dify-guide)

This is a personal project, not an official guide from Dify.

This applies [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) thinking, but the internet meme version.

I will make is as simple as possible.

Most part from this guide is based on my own experience, so it may not be 100% accurate, and **may not up to date**.

Some of the cases are from Dify's Discord server or GitHub issues, and some may involve interesting or little-known secrets (with privacy-sensitive information removed).
