A Friendly, Easy-to-Follow Guide for Dify Newcomers

## Introduction

This guide is designed for Dify users of all levels, from beginners to advanced.

Crafted with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [AlterXYZ](https://github.com/alterxyz/easy-dify-guide)

Please note that this is a personal project and not an official guide from Dify.

This guide applies [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) thinking, simplified for easy understanding.

Our goal is to make this guide as straightforward as possible.

Most of the content is based on personal experience, so it may not be 100% accurate or up-to-date.

Some examples are sourced from Dify's Discord server or GitHub issues, and may include interesting or lesser-known information (with sensitive details removed).

- Dify's official documentation has room for improvement. They're busy with development and expansion; their efforts are far greater than we imagine.

- Maybe you can say that this guide is an Eng-to-Eng translation.

- My original thought was "I'll just whip this up in GitHub Markdown and call it a day." LOL!

- I'm happy to answer many questions, but a significant portion are actually covered in the documentation.

- When I open the docs to find a specific section and plan to share a link, I often think: "Sorry, I don't really want to read this either üòÇ. Let me just explain how to solve the problem simply by typing it out."
